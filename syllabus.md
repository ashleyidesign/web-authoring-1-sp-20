## Course Description

Web Authoring 1 is an introductory course to authoring and publishing content for the web. Students learn to read, write, and speak HTML and CSS, as well as, study the past and present history of the web. Web Authoring 1 focuses on the basics of modern web design through a series of projects exploring type, color, image, and layout.

## Criteria for Credit

### Competencies

#### Formal

- Proficiency in writing semantic and valid HTML and CSS
- Proficiency in the use of semantic and decorative style for formal and expressive typography and design
- Proficiency in designing ease-to-use “don’t make me think” navigation
- Proficiency in designing readable and accessible content for sighted and non-sighted users
- Proficiency in the use of color for accessible and inclusive communication for sighted and non-sighted users

#### Technical

- Proficiency in the technology and tools for digital design, designing in the browser, and publishing for web
  - Illustrator, Sketch, or Inkscape, maybe InDesign, but *not* Photoshop
  - Text editor for authoring Markdown, HTML, and CSS
  - Browser developer tools for inspecting and testing
  - GitHub for development and publishing
- Proficiency in producing both low and high-fidelity paper and digital comps for presentation

#### Conceptual

- Proficiency in separating content and structure from style and behavior
- Proficiency in using a mobile first and progressive enhancement design approach
- Proficiency in designing for the reader; designing an accessible and inclusive experience for all users and devices

### Attendance

Come to class. Don’t miss class, but if you need to, let me know at least an hour in advance via Slack or email; *not* 10 or 15 minutes before the start of class. I’ll do the same. *Thank-you.*

Also, if you’re ill and need to stay home, you can still attend class via Google Hangouts; watch the lecture, and check-in with me via Slack. I’m flexible, just let me know what’s going on, and let’s work remotely when it makes sense.

Bottom line, don’t miss more than six (6) classes; that’s missing 3 weeks of class, and will result in a lower grade by at least 20%. For example, with six (6) absences, an “A” (94–100%) becomes a “B-” (80–82%). And, if you think you may miss more than six (6) classes, consider dropping, else you may receive a final grade of No Credit (NC).

## Lessons

1. [Ebb & Flow](lessons/01-ebb-and-flow.md)
    - Write a summary and illustrate an image for the seminal article “[A Dao of Web Design](https://alistapart.com/article/dao)” by John Allsopp, then as a class, we’ll work together to develop a responsive single-page website with semantic markup, flexible images, and a fluid grid.
2. [Content First](lessons/02-content-first.md)
    - Design a modern-day type specimen single-page website for a not so modern web safe font, make it “cool” again, and showcase that accessible type, color, and layout is not only *cool*, but a *best practice* for inclusive and responsible web design.
3. [Device Agnostic](lessons/03-device-agnostic.md)
    - Deconstruct a single or series of physical “hold-in-your-hands” printed page(s), heavy on typography and white-space, light on imagery and decoration, and develop a responsive web friendly version for both screen and print.
4. [Single Serving](lessons/04-single-serving.md)
    - Design a modern responsive single serving website — a single-page with a single-theme based on self-generated content; focusing on type, color, image, and layout; as well as rad (reliable, authentic, and direct) voice and tone, visual design, and user experience.
5. Final (TBA)
